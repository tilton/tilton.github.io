# Jekyll Boilerplate
Jekyll boilerplate is a starter kit for Jekyll themes.

The repo is setup with a gulpfile to load _config-dev.yml instad of a production config file while I'm building my theme. It uses browser-sync to watch the `_site` directory for changes.

I wrote a blog post about [how I build custom Genesis child themes](https://bradonomics.com/genesis-boilerplate/). The notes in that post are very applicable to this repo.

The install scrip in that post is only applicable to the Genesis Boilerplate repo. You can find a Jekyll Boilerplate install script here: https://github.com/bradonomics/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/install-jekyll.sh.

## Getting Started

To start your a theme with Jekyll Boilerplate, you can [Download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) (or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate.git`). Remember this is a starting point for a custom theme and pretty vanilla as is. If it doesn't make it into 90% of my custom theme work, it isn't in the boilerplate.

### What's in the download?

The download includes some dummy content (most of which I swiped from Michael Rose's [unit test repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test)) to to check styles and formatting, a gulp file with my preferred tasks, a development configuration file to help with the build, and probably some other things I'm forgetting.
